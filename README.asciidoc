What it this
------------

In this repository I keep my kate editor syntax files and snippets.

  - To install syntax files just symlink them from work copy to `~/.kde4/share/apps/katepart/syntax` directory.
  - To install code snippets symlink 'em to `~/.kde4/share/apps/ktexteditor_snippets/data` directory.

Changelog for C++ syntax is here: http://kde-files.org/content/show.php?content=90660

Changelog for GNU GCC specific snippets is here: http://kde-files.org/content/show.php?content=144138

Changelog for boost::test snippets is here: http://kde-files.org/content/show.php?content=144143
